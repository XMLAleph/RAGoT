# RAGoT
Source code and demo of project RAGoT. Include code of experiments and Web QA system.

This version is for test and temporary demonstrate. The details will be updated in the coming days. You can run the source code to repeat all of the experiments or start the qa system. Of course, as the RAGoT framework use GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct as its core llm, you need to provide your **own** api-key :-)
Besides, to start the qa system on colab, I used [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), which also need an api-key, you can get it for free.

This is a demo for web QA system:

The RAGoT framework is based on [IRCoT](https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/ircot), which I'll also cite in the corresponding paper.
