# RAGoT
Source code and demo of project RAGoT. Include code of experiments and Web QA system.

This version is for test and temporary demonstrate. You can run the source code to repeat all of the experiments or start the qa system. Of course, as the RAGoT framework use GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct as its core llm, you need to provide your **own** api-key :-)
The RAGoT framework is based on [IRCoT](https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/ircot).
