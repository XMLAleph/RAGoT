Wikipedia Title: Rutebeuf
Rutebeuf (or Rustebuef) (fl. 1245 – 1285), a trouvère, was born in the first half of the 13th century, possibly in Champagne (he describes conflicts in Troyes in 1249); he was evidently of humble birth, and he was a Parisian by education and residence. His name is nowhere mentioned by his contemporaries. He frequently plays in his verse on the word "Rutebeuf", which was a "nom de plume", and is variously explained by him as derived from "rude boeuf" and "rude oeuvre" ("coarse ox" or "rustic piece of work"). Paulin Paris thought that he began life in the lowest rank of the minstrel profession as a "jongleur" (juggler and musician). Some of his poems have autobiographical value. In "Le Mariage de Rutebeuf" ("The Marriage of Rutebeuf") he says that on the 2 January 1261 he married a woman old and ugly, with neither dowry nor amiability. In the "Complainte de Rutebeuf" he details a series of misfortunes which have reduced him to abject destitution. In these circumstances he addresses himself to Alphonse, comte de Poitiers, brother of Louis IX, for relief.

They traded with Europeans for centuries, often providing them with the knowledge and resources needed to survive here. Mi’kmaq spirituality and way of life have been based on respectful and sustainable use of natural resources. They usually lived along rivers; summers along coast and winters inland to hunt. Up to 90% of food came from river and sea area. Mi’kmaq, respecting others’ ways of belief as well as their own, welcomed the French religion of Catholicism into their lives and befriended the French at Port Royal in 1605 where Chief Membertou became Catholic. Peace and Friendship treaties negotiated with the British between 1725 and 1761 are still valid today. The treaties recognized Mi’kmaq title and established rules for an ongoing relationship between nations; they did not surrender or cede lands. The arrival of Planters created economic, environmental and cultural pressures on the Mi'kmaq. A census of 1763 by Isaac Deschamps stated that the following Mi’kmaq men plus 19 unnamed women and 41 children hunted along the Kennetcook River: Joseph Nocoot— Captain, Charles Nocoot, Barth.
